UniTime is an application that started during university years due to the lack of a way to quickly view class schedules. The main goal of UniTime is to provide a clear and simple view of academic commitments, helping students organize their time more efficiently.

UniTime also offers the option to add multiple courses together and view schedules in daily or weekly view.
